# Abstract

Studies have shown that road traffic crashes are one of the leading causes of unnatural death for U.S citizens. In our research, in the paper three questions are addressed about crashes in Wake County, North Carolina: (1) Where are the hotspots for crashes in the Wake County area?; (2) Can we reliably forecast the daily/monthly number of crashes in Wake County? Given the weather and road features and driversâ€™ characteristics, can we predict the crash outcome (whether it results in injuries)? To accomplish this aim, two public datasets covering the period between January 2015 to May 2021 obtained from the North Carolina Wake County Open Data Portal were used (persons involved in crashes and crash locations). The paper answers the above research questions using a combination of exploratory data analysis techniques, time series forecasting techniques and predictive modeling techniques. After conducting research it has been found that hot spots in Wake County like 440, 40, and Capital Blvd are known to have the most accidents since they are the most common roads. Additionally, pandemic is one of the prominent factors that affects crash counts and car crash forecasts, and the best models for forecasting car crashes of the different subgroups of data were TBATS, ARIMA, HoltWinters, and a combination of STLF and SARIMA. Furthermore, the best way to model injury types was by applying random forest with a combination of over and undersampling on a subsample and by utilizing logistic regression with a combination of under and oversampling on a full sample.
